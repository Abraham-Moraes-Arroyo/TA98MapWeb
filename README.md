This is a project that I worked in the Summer of 2021. The main purpose of the project was to create a web app where the residents of Little Village can find parks near them to go to that have certain features. The features could be basketball courts, pools, turf fields, and more. It could also points out to the schools around the area, so the parents of the child can know where to take their children to play that is a safe place. 

I used Google API Key, Bootstrap, HTML, TypeScript, Python, and JSON; to creeate the web app. I feel confident that I gave my best effort in order to make the user their best experience. 

I don't grant access to anyone to use this code without my permission.
